# TechByte-MVC

## Motivation

The motivation for this project is to provide developers with a convenient and efficient way to read, learn or write about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. The user will be able to create an account where they can share their blogs as well as comment on other developer's posts. This application will follow the MVC paradigm in its structure.

In completing this project, I have learned the basic concepts of MySQL, Sequelize, and Express-Handlebars.js. I have also learned the benefits of utilizing modular routes to maintain cleaner code.
